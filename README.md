This algorithm aims to cut a polytope into n equally sized areas using voronoi partitions
A weighting function is used to shift the centroids in a way that
big areas tend to get smaller and the other way around

To have a look do:
1) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) `python example.py`
Used version of python is 3.7.3
